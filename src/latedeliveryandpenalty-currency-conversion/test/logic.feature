Feature: Late delivery contract
  This describe the expected behavior for the Accord Project's late delivery and penalty contract

  Background:
    Given that the contract says
"""
## Late Delivery and Penalty.

In case of delayed delivery except for Force Majeure cases,
"Dan" (the Seller) shall pay to "Steve" (the Buyer) for every 2 days
of delay penalty amounting to 10.5% of the total value of the Equipment
whose delivery has been delayed. Any fractional part of a days is to be
considered a full days. The total amount of penalty shall not however,
exceed 55% of the total value of the Equipment involved in late delivery.
If the delay is more than 15 days, the Buyer is entitled to terminate this Contract.
All Equipment values are based on EUR and all penalty payments will be paid in USD at its equivalent amount in EUR. The conversion rate between the currencies is based upon "the prevailing exchange rate at a major United States bank".
"""

  Scenario: The contract should not allow the late delivery clause to be triggered when the delivery is on time
    When the current time is "2019-01-11T16:34:00-05:00"
    And it receives the request

    Then it should reject the request with the error "[Ergo] Cannot exercise late delivery before delivery date"
