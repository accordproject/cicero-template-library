## Volume-Based Card Acceptance Agreement [Abbreviated]

This Agreement is by and between Card, Inc., a New York corporation, and you, the Merchant. By accepting the Card, you agree to be bound by the Agreement. 
Discount means an amount that we charge you for accepting the Card, which amount is: 

1. a percentage (Discount Rate) of the face amount of the Charge that you submit, or a flat per-
Transaction fee, or a combination of both; and/or 
1. a Monthly Flat Fee (if you meet our requirements).

Transaction Processing and Payments. Our Card acceptance, processing, and payment requirements are set forth in the Merchant Regulations. Some requirements are summarized here for ease of reference, but do not supersede the provisions in the Merchant Regulations.
Payment for Charges. We will pay you, through our agent, according to your payment plan in US dollars for the face amount of Charges submitted from your Establishments less all applicable deductions, rejections, and withholdings, which include:
