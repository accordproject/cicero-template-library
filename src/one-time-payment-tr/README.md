# Accord Protocol Template: one-time-payment-tr

This is an Full Payment Upon Signature Protocol prepared in Turkish Language.

### Parse
Use the `cicero parse` command to load a template from a directory on disk and then use it to parse input text, echoing the result of parsing. If the input text is valid the parsing result will be a JSON serialized instance of the Template Mode:

Sample template.tem:

```
        1.1 Banka [{seller}]
        1.2 Müşteri [{buyer}]

        7. Upon the signing of this Agreement, [{buyer}] shall pay the total purchase price to [{seller}] in the amount of [{totalPurchasePrice}].
```

Sample.txt:

```
        1.1 Banka "ACME Corp."
        1.2 Müşteri "Can Doğan"

        7. Upon the signing of this Agreement, "Umut" shall pay the total purchase price to "Serkan" in the amount of 1922.99 TRY.
```

```
cicero parse --template ./one-time-payment-tr/ --dsl ./one-time-payment-tr/sample.txt
Setting clause data: {"$class": "org.accordtr.onetimepayment.InitRequest"}
```

### Execute
Use the `cicero execute` command to load a template from a directory on disk, instantiate a clause based on input text, and then invoke the clause using an incoming JSON payload.

```
data.json:
{
   "$class": "org.accordtr.onetimepayment.InitRequest"
}
```

```
cicero execute --template ./one-time-payment-tr/ --dsl ./one-time-payment-tr/sample.txt --data ./one-time-payment-tr/data.json 
```

The results of execution (a JSON serialized object) are displayed. They include:
* Details of the clause executed (name, version, SHA256 hash of clause data)
* The incoming request object
* The output response object

```
