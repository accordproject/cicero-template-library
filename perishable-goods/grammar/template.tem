On receipt of the shipment {{shipment}} the importer {{importer}} pays the grower {{grower}} {{unitPrice}} USD per {{unit}}. The shipment must contain between {{minUnits}} and {{maxUnits}} {{unit}} of {{product}}.

Shipping containers used must be temperature and humidity controlled, and sensor readings must be logged at least {{sensorReadingFrequency}} per {{duration}}.

Shipments that arrive after {{dueDate}} are to be considered spoiled and must be arranged to be returned to or disposed of by grower at cost to grower.

Temperature readings for the shipment must be between {{minTemperature}} and {{maxTemperature}}.

Humidity readings for the shipment must be between {{minHumidity}} and {{maxHumidity}}.

Shipments that have a temperature or humidity reading outside the agreed range have a price penalty applied calculated using the Formula for Breach Penalty Calculation below. The breach penalty factor to be used is {{penaltyFactor}}.

Formula for Breach Penalty Calculation:
   penalty = number of shipment units x difference between sensor reading and agreed range x breach penalty factor
