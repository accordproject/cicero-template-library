## Running this clause

### On your own machine

1. [Download the Cicero template library](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero-template-library/archive/master.zip)

2. Unzip the library with your favourite tool

3. Then from the command-line, change the current directory to the folder containing this README.md file.
```
cd helloworld
```
4. With the [Cicero command-line tool](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero#installation):
```
cicero execute --template ./ --sample ./sample.txt --request ./request.json --state ./state.json
```

Alternatively you can use the simpler command below if you want to use all of the default files.
