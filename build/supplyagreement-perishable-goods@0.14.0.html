Schedule A.
{{shipment}} {{unitPrice}} per {{unit}}

Annex A. Delivery Method
Shipping containers used must be temperature and humidity controlled, and sensor readings must be logged at least {{sensorReadingFrequency}} per {{duration}}.

Annex B. Acceptance Criteria
The shipment must contain between {{minUnits}} and {{maxUnits}} {{unit}} of {{product}}.
Temperature readings for the shipment must be between {{minTemperature}}°C and {{maxTemperature}}°C.
Humidity readings for the shipment must be between {{minHumidity}}% and {{maxHumidity}}%.
Shipments that have a temperature or humidity reading outside the agreed range have a price penalty applied calculated using the Formula for Breach Penalty Calculation below. The breach penalty factor to be used is {{penaltyFactor}}.
Formula for Breach Penalty Calculation:
penalty = number of shipment units x difference between sensor reading and agreed range x breach penalty factor</code></pre>
