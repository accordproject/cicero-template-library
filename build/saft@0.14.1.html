<p>(c)  The Purchaser enters into this SAFT with the predominant expectation that he, she or it, as the case may be, will profit upon the successful development and Network Launch arising from the efforts of the Company and its employees to develop and market the "Clause Network" and the Network Launch and related sale of the Tokens.</p>

(ii) The Purchaser will provide to the Company a network address for which to allocate Purchaser's Tokens upon the Network Launch.
(b) Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before this instrument expires or terminates, the Company will pay an amount equal to the Purchase Amount multiplied by the Discount Rate (the “Discounted Purchase Amount”), due and payable to the Purchaser immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Dissolution Event{{#if amendmentProvision}}, subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of the Company’s preferred stock, as set forth in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be amended from time to time.{{/if}} If immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the assets of the Company that remain legally available for distribution to the Purchaser and all holders of all other SAFTs (the “Dissolving Purchasers”), as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Purchasers of their respective Discounted Purchase Amounts, then the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution, following all distributions to the holders of the Company’s preferred stock, will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Purchasers in proportion to the Discounted Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1(b).  Any distributed amounts shall be in U.S. Dollars.

(c) Termination.  This instrument will expire and terminate upon the earlier of (i) the issuance of Tokens to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(a); (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(b); (iii) {{deadlineDate}} (the “Deadline Date”), if the Network Launch has not occurred as of such date; provided that, the Company shall have the right to extend the Deadline Date by sixty (60) days, in its sole discretion; and (iv) the failure to obtain net proceeds of more than {{netProceedLimit}} from the sale of all rights pursuant to the SAFTs; provided, that in the case of (iv), the Company shall have the obligation to repay to the Purchasers the aggregate amount of all Purchase Amounts.
1. Definitions

1. Company Representations
   (a)  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of {{state}}, and has the power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and carry on its business as now conducted.

This instrument constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.  To the knowledge of the Company, it is not in violation of (i) its current articles of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) any material statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, or (iii) any material indenture or contract to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, where, in each case, such violation or default, individually, or together with all such violations or defaults, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

(c)  To the knowledge of the Company, the performance and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this instrument do not and will not: (i) violate any material judgment, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company; (ii) result in the acceleration of any material indenture or contract to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property, asset or revenue of the Company or the suspension, forfeiture, or nonrenewal of any material permit, license or authorization applicable to the Company, its business or operations.

1. Purchaser Representations
   (a)  The Purchaser has full legal capacity, power and authority to execute and deliver this instrument and to perform its obligations hereunder. This instrument constitutes valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.

(b)  The Purchaser has been advised that this instrument is a security and that the offers and sales of this instrument have not been registered under any country’s securities laws and, therefore, cannot be resold except in compliance with the applicable country’s laws.

(c)  The Purchaser enters into this SAFT with the predominant expectation that he, she or it, as the case may be, will profit upon the successful development and Network Launch arising from the efforts of the Company and its employees to develop and market the {{network}} and the Network Launch and related sale of the Tokens.
