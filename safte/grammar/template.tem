SAFTE 
(Simple Agreement for Future Tokens or Equity)

THIS CERTIFIES THAT in exchange for the payment by [{purchaser}] (the “Purchaser”) of $[{purchaseAmount}] (the “Purchase Amount”) to [{companyName}], a limited company incorporated in [{jurisdiction}] with company number [{companyRegistrationNumber}] (the “Company”), the Company hereby issues to the Purchaser the right to either:- (1) cryptographic tokens in the [{projectName}] (the “Tokens”); or (2) certain shares in the Company’s share capital, in either case on the terms set forth below. 
The “Discount Rate” is 100 minus [{discount}]%.
See Section 2 for certain additional defined terms.
1.	Events

	(a) 	Token Sale. In the event that the Company or any Nominated Entity operates a Qualifying Token Sale, the Company will automatically issue to the Purchaser, or will take all reasonable steps to procure that the Nominated Entity promptly issues to the Purchaser, a number of Tokens equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Discount Rate (the Purchaser Tokens). If the Qualifying Token Sale is offered at different prices depending on the time at which Tokens are purchased, the Purchase Amount will be considered to have been at the most advantageous rate publicly marketed.
If the Company elects to operate the Qualifying Token Sale using a Nominated Entity, it will inform the Purchaser in writing. The performance by the Nominated Entity of the obligations of the Company under this agreement will duly discharge the obligations of the Company to the Purchaser. 
	(b)	Equity Financing. If there is an Equity Financing before the expiration or termination of this agreement, and the Purchaser has not received Purchaser Tokens pursuant to Section 1(a), the Company will automatically issue to the Purchaser a number of SAFTE Shares equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Discount Price.
	In connection with the issuance of SAFTE Shares by the Company to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 1(b): 
(i) The Purchaser will execute and deliver to the Company all transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Equity Financing Shares, with appropriate variations for the SAFTE Shares if applicable, and provided further, that such documents have customary exceptions to any drag-along rights and obligations applicable to the Purchaser, including, without limitation, limited representations and warranties and limited liability and indemnification obligations on the part of the Purchaser; and 
(ii)	The Purchaser and the Company will execute a Pro Rata Rights Agreement, unless the Purchaser is already included in such rights in the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing.
		(c)	Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before this agreement expires or terminates, the Company will pay an amount equal to the Purchase Amount, due and payable to the Purchaser immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Dissolution Event. The Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Company to holders of outstanding Capital Shares by reason of their ownership thereof. If immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the Purchaser and all holders of all other SAFTEs (the “Dissolving Purchasers”), as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Purchasers of their respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Purchasers in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1(c).
	(d)	Termination.  This agreement will expire and terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this agreement) upon either (i) the issuance of Tokens to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(a); or (ii) the issuance of shares to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(b); or (iii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(c).
