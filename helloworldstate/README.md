# Hello World 

This is a smart legal clause that conforms to the [Accord Protocol Template Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UacA_r2KGcBA2D4voDgGE8jqid-Uh4Dt09AE-shBKR0), the protocol is managed by the open-source community of the [Accord Project](https://accordproject.org). The clause can be parsed and executed by the [Cicero](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero) engine.

## Description

> This is the stateful Hello World of Accord Protocol Templates. Executing the clause will simply echo back the text that occurs after the string `Hello` prepended to text that is passed in the request along with the number of times the clause has been called.

This clause contains:
- *Some sample Clause Text* - [sample.txt](sample.txt)
- *A template* - [grammar/template.tem](grammar/template.tem)
- *A data model* - [models/model.cto](models/model.cto)
- *Contact logic* (in JavaScript) - [logic/logic.js](lib/logic.js)

## Running this clause

### On your own machine

1. [Download the Cicero template library](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero-template-library/archive/master.zip)

2. Unzip the library with your favourite tool

3. Then from the command-line, change the current directory to the folder containing this README.md file.
```
cd helloworldstate
```
4. With the [Cicero command-line tool](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero#installation):
```
cicero execute --template ./ --sample ./sample.txt --request ./request.json --state./state.json
```
> Note, all of the command-line flags (like `--template`) are optional.

Alternatively you can use the simpler command below if you want to use all of the default files.
```
cicero execute
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:
```bash
mattmbp:helloworldstate matt$ cicero execute

```

The contract state changes every time you call the clause. If you pass more than one requests on the command line, the input will use the state to return the number of times it has been called:

```
cicero execute --template ./ --sample ./sample.txt --request ./request.json --request ./request.json --request ./request.json
14:31:19 - info: Logging initialized. 2018-05-07T18:31:19.790Z

```

### Sample Payload Data


Request, as in [data.json](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero-template-library/blob/master/helloworld/data.json)
```json
{
    "$class": "org.accordproject.helloworld.Request",
    "input": "Accord Project"
}

```

For the request above, you should see the following response:
```json
{
    "$class": "org.accordproject.helloworld.Response",
    "output": "Hello Fred Blogs Accord Project(1)",
    "transactionId": "8b0ec544-6fe1-4894-9044-18d1d568dce1",
