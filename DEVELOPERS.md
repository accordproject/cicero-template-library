## <a name="setup"> Development Setup

This document describes how to set up your development environment to build and test Cicero Template Library, and
explains the basic mechanics of using `git`, `node`, `npm`.

### Installing Dependencies

Before you can build Cicero Template Library, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your
machine:

* [Git][git]: The [Github Guide to Installing Git][git-setup] is a good source of information.

* [Node.js v10.16.0 'Dubnium' (LTS)][node]: We use Node to generate the documentation, run a
  development web server, run tests, and generate distributable files. Depending on your system,
  you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

  We recommend using [nvm][nvm] (or [nvm-windows][nvm-windows])
  to manage and install Node.js, which makes it easy to change the version of Node.js per project.

### Forking Cicero Template Library on Github

To contribute code to Cicero Template Library, you must have a GitHub account so you can push code to your own
fork of Cicero Template Library and open Pull Requests in the [GitHub Repository][github].

To create a Github account, follow the instructions [here][github-signup].
Afterwards, go ahead and [fork][github-forking] the
[main Cicero Template Library repository][github].

### Keeping In Sync

It is good practice to always keep your `origin/master` in sync with `upstream/master`. You donâ€™t have to, but it makes your life easier. Do your work in branches of your fork, and periodically sync up your `master` with the `master` of `upstream` as follows. You should definitely do this before creating a pull request.

```shell
    git fetch --all --prune
    git checkout master
    git merge --ff-only upstream/master
    git push origin master
```

### <a name="unit-tests"></a> Running the Unit Test Suite

We write unit and integration tests with Enzyme and execute them with Jest. To run all of the
tests once on Chrome run:

```shell
    npm run test
```

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more [specs][developers.unit-tests].
* All public API methods **must be documented** with jsdoc. To see how we document our APIs, please check
  out the existing source code and see the section about [writing documentation][developers.documentation].
* With the exceptions listed below, we follow the rules contained in
  [Google's JavaScript Style Guide][google].

## <a name="commits"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history** and **git logs**.  
But also, we use the git commit messages to **generate the Cicero Template Library change log**.

The commit message formatting can be added using a version of typical git workflow.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a mandatory **type**, **scope**, **subject**, and **footer**. This is a specific format:

```shell
    <type>(<scope>): <subject> - <footer>
```

This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the subject, where it 
should say: `this reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
A commit with this format is automatically created by the [`git revert`][git-revert] command.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **`feat`**: A new feature
* **`fix`**: A bug fix
* **`docs`**: Documentation only changes
* **`style`**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **`perf`**: A code change that improves performance
* **`test`**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **`chore`**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### Scope
The scope will be specifying the place of the commit change; the focal point of new code or best 
description for where changes can be found.

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* kept under 50 characters
* no dot (.) at the end

### Footer
The footer should contain [reference GitHub Issues][github-issues] that this commit addresses.

## <a name="pullrequests"></a> GitHub Pull Request Guidelines
Pull Requests should consist of a complete addition to the code which contains value. 
Because the commits inside follow a pattern, the title should be an extension or summary of all the commits inside.

Pull Request titles should follow [commit message formatting][developers.commits].

Formatting for the body is displayed in this example:

```shell
# Issue #20

### Changes
- Change one
  - Subchange one
  - Subchange two
- Change two
- Theoretically this should be listing all the commit messages included in this PR

### Flags
- Possible issues or holds for reviewers to note
- List any breaking changes here.

### Related Issues
- Link any issues or pull requests relating to this
```

When approved and ready to merge, a Pull Request should be squashed down to a single buildable commit and merged into master.

## <a name="documentation"></a> Writing Documentation

The Cicero Template Library project uses [jsdoc][jsdoc] for all of its code
documentation.

This means that all the docs are stored inline in the source code and so are kept in sync as it
changes.

This means that since we generate the documentation from the source code, we can easily provide
version-specific documentation by simply checking out a version of Cicero Template Library and running the build.
